A knowledge graph is a structured representation of knowledge, where entities (such as people, places, or things) and their relationships are interconnected, much like a map of knowledge.\nKnowledge graphs are transforming how we access and interact with information. They power search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants\nSO how can social scientists benefit from knowlegde graphs?"

    "text": "Knowlege Graph: Bill Gates\nKnowledge graphs are defined as graphs of data that accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world. The nodes in knowledge graphs represent the entities of interest, and the edges represent the relations between the entities (Peng et al. 2023)\n https://explore.gnd.network/en/gnd/119081199/relations\n\n\nWhat is the cool thing about graphs? unlike relational databases you do not have tables, so no columns and rows to query from. But your query is a path. Example: retrieve the birth place of someone’s husband.\nThese representations utilize formal semantics, which allows computers to process them efficiently and unambiguously. For example, the entity “Bill Gates” can be linked to the entity “Microsoft” because Bill Gates is the founder of Microsoft; thus, they have relationships in the real world."
